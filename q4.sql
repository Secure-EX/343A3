/*
Find the list of all customers younger than 30 years old who changed at least 2 reservations in the past 18 months.
Note: Youâ€™re required to return a list of customer IDs

- Customers ID in this case is customer e-mail.
- Since we don't have a timestamp indicating when the reservation was made in this schema, you may use FromDate for this query.
- Please note that it's in the past 18 month with reference to the time of query execution (i.e. server time).
- You may find some of the Date/Time functions and operators in this PostgreSQL documentation page helpful.

- You should not hard code specific dates in the query! In other words, your query should NOT say that FromDate > '2016-09-10' or any other specific date in there.
- You can assume that we meant 30 day months (i.e. 30 * 18 = 540 days).
- A reservation "change" refers to cases where the old reservation is cancelled AND replaced with a new reservation.
  In other words, we're concerned with reservations where OLD_RESERVATION_ID is not null.
  Simply canceling a reservation doesn't count in this case. (See discussion in @871).
